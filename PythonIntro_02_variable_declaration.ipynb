    "This is a Jupyter notebook. This is a smart and easy way to run Python-code interactively in the browser. The term *interactively* means that we at any time can stop the process and see the individual outputs, change variable expressions or plot the intermediate results. This notebook can also be run on ERDA and Google Drive, which means that you do not have to have Python installed on your own computer to run the files, although I recommend having a local installation up and running as your primary place of coding. Python and Jupyter notebooks are available for all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), for free. I recommend installing the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Python, which comes with a lot of useful packages pre-installed, as well as text editors especially designed for Python (Spider and JupyterLab). \n",

It is not meant as a comprehensive introduction to Python, but rather as a quick guide to get you started.\n",

    "## Variable declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is and *object-oriented* programming language, which means that everything you create, every variable you declare, is an object. Objects have attributes and methods. Attributes are properties of the object, and methods are functions that can be applied to the object. For example, a *list* is an object, and it has attributes such as the length of the list, and methods such as sorting the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also a *dynamically typed* programming language, which means that you do not have to declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type of the variable is inferred from the value you assign to it. This is different from *statically typed* languages such as C, C++ and Java, where you have to declare the type of the variable when you create it. "
