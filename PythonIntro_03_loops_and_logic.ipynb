    "# Introduction to Python\n",

    "This is a Jupyter notebook. This is a smart and easy way to run Python-code interactively in the browser. The term *interactively* means that we at any time can stop the process and see the individual outputs, change variable expressions or plot the intermediate results. This notebook can also be run on ERDA and Google Drive, which means that you do not have to have Python installed on your own computer to run the files, although I recommend having a local installation up and running as your primary place of coding. Python and Jupyter notebooks are available for all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), for free. I recommend installing the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Python, which comes with a lot of useful packages pre-installed, as well as text editors especially designed for Python (Spider and JupyterLab). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant as a very basic introduction to Python, and specifically control flow tools, such as loops and conditionals. It is not meant as a comprehensive introduction to Python, but rather as a quick guide to get you started.\n",

This will tell the interpreter that it should make a list with the numbers 0, ..., 9.  For each of these numbers, it will assign `i` to the given value and perform whatever is inside the *loop block* with that specific value of `i`.  "
